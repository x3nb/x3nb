Notes & quick snippets

Memberstack (example)

Add this in <head>: <script src="https://api.memberstack.io/static/memberstack.js" data-memberstack="YOUR_MEMBERSTACK_ID" defer></script>
Gating: add data-ms-membership="PLAN-ID" attributes on links or sections, see Memberstack docs to hide/show elements.
Circle embed example (add to topic.html where you want the widget):

Circle provides an embed script in your workspace UI. It typically looks like: <script defer src="https://circle.so/embed.js"></script> <div data-circle-embed data-space="YOUR_SPACE_ID" data-target="#circle-embed-target"></div>
Discourse:

For a separate hosted Discourse forum, use links to it (easiest).
For SSO integration, you'll need a server endpoint that returns HMAC-signed payloads to Discourse SSO. I can provide a Node/Serverless example if you want SSO.
Hosting tips

Deploy to Netlify: drag & drop or connect GitHub. Add your provider scripts and environment variables in provider dashboards (Memberstack, Circle).
Vercel: similar. For redirects, add a simple catch-all if needed.
If you want me to wire up a live demo with your Memberstack and Circle test keys I can:

Inject the provider scripts into the templates,
Add a simple Netlify serverless function (if needed) for SSO or Stripe Checkout,
Deploy to a demo URL and hand you the repo.
Tell me which provider(s) you want (Memberstack | Memberful | MemberSpace | Netlify Identity; Circle | Discourse) and whether you want me to:

A) Fill these templates with actual embed scripts and deploy a demo (I’ll need test keys), or
B) Leave the templates as-is and provide exact copy/paste snippets you can drop in yourself.
I can also zip the files or create a GitHub repo. Which next step do you want?

Great — I’ll prepare a complete set of static HTML templates plus a focused integration guide so you can run a membership forum using entirely static hosting plus third‑party membership/forum providers. Below I’m providing:

A README (integration guide) with recommended provider options and step‑by‑step setup instructions.
Static template files: index, category, topic, auth (login/register), profile, admin stub.
A single CSS file and a small JS file showing how to:
Hook a membership provider (Memberstack / Memberful / MemberSpace)
Embed a hosted forum (Circle or Discourse)
Protect/gate content client‑side (for static sites, done via provider)
Example Netlify _redirects for clean routing (if you host on Netlify)
You can host these files on Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or S3+CloudFront. Once you pick which membership provider (Memberstack, Memberful, MemberSpace, or Firebase/Netlify Identity) and whether you want an embedded forum (Circle) or a separate hosted forum (Discourse), I can adapt the templates and add the exact provider keys/snippets.

Below are the files. After these I’ll list short next steps you can pick.
